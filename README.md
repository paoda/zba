Most recently built on Zig [v0.10.0-dev.662+e139c41fd](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/tree/e139c41fd8955f873615b2c2434d162585c0e44c)

### Dependencies

    * [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php)

On windows, it's easiest if you use [`vcpkg`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg) to install `sdl2:x64-windows`.

Once you've installed all the dependencies, run `zig build -Drelease-fast`. The executable is located at `zig-out/bin/`.
